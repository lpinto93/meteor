## v.NEXT

* Improve minimongo performance on updating documents when there are
  many active observes. #5627

* Split up `standard-minifiers` in separate CSS (`standard-minifiers-css`) and JS
  minifiers(`standard-minifiers-js`). `standard-minifiers` now acts as an umbrella package for these
  2 minifiers.

* Move `DDPRateLimiter` to the server only, since it won't work if it is called from the client. It
  will now error if referenced from the client at all.

* Allow `git+` URL schemes for npm dependencies #844

## v.1.2.1, 2015-Oct-26

* `coll.insert()` now uses a faster (but cryptographically insecure)
  algorithm to generate document IDs when called outside of a method
  and an `_id` field is not explicitly passed. With this change, there
  are no longer two algorithms used to generate document
  IDs. `Random.id()` can still be used to generate cryptographically
  secure document IDs. [#5161](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/5161)

* The `ecmascript-collections` package has been renamed to
  `ecmascript-runtime` and now includes a more complete selection of
  ES2015 polyfills and shims from [`core-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/core-js).
  The complete list can be found
  [here](https://github.com/meteor/ecmascript-runtime/blob/master/server.js).

* Check type of `onException` argument to `bindEnvironment`. [#5271](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/5271)

* WebApp's `PORT` environment variable can now be a named pipe to better support
  deployment on IIS on Windows. [4413](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/4413)

* `Template.dynamic` can be now used as a block helper:
  `{{#Template.dynamic}} ... {{/Template.dynamic}}` [#4756](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/4756)

* `Collection#allow/deny` now throw errors when passed falsy values. [#5442](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/5442)

* `source-map` has been updated to a newer patch version, which fixes major bugs
  in particular around loading bundles generated by Webpack. [#5411](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/5411)

* `check` now returns instead of throwing errors internally, which should make
  it much faster. `check` is used in many core Meteor packages, so this should
  result in small performance improvements across the framework. [#4584](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/4584)

* The `userEmail` option to `Meteor.loginWithMeteorDeveloperAccount` has been
  renamed to `loginHint`, and now supports Google accounts as well. The old
  option still works for backwards compatibility. [#2422](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/2422) [#5313](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/5313)

* The old `addFiles` API for adding package assets no longer throws an error,
  making it easier to share packages between pre- and post-1.2 versions of
  Meteor. [#5458](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/5458)

* Normally, you can't deploy to free meteor.com hosting or Galaxy from a
  non-Linux machine if you have *local* non-published packages with binary
  dependencies, nor can you run `meteor build --architecture SomeOtherArch`. As
  a temporary workaround, if you set the `METEOR_BINARY_DEP_WORKAROUND`
  variable, you will be able to deploy to Galaxy (but not free meteor.com
  hosting), and tarballs built with `meteor build` will contain a
  `programs/server/setup.sh` shell script which should be run on the server to
  install those packages.
